        <li> Referring to the section in the handout titled Purpose of graphics in web design, what do you feel is the purpose of the graphics on the page you selected?</li>
        <br> 
        The purpose is suppose to help others get information about what is going on, to allow teachers and students to get work and to check grades and allow parents to check for events.
        <br>
        <br>
    
        <li>Referring to the section in the handout titled Guidelines for effective use of web graphics, how well does the page you selected meet these guidelines? Which guidelines does it do especially well on, if any? Which guidelines does it fail to meet?</li>
        <br>
        The web graphics on the page are well done and do not get int the way, these graphics do meet the guidelines for the handout. The guide lines it does especially well is that it allows the viewer to focus on what is important on the page, the graphics fit on the page with a purpose and is orabized, and the page avoids using graphics that would be obnoxious or brightly colored.
        <br>
        The website I chose did not fail any of the guidelines for web graphics.

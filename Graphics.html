        <li> Referring to the section in the handout titled Purpose of graphics in web design, what do you feel is the purpose of the graphics on the page you selected?</li>
        <br> 
        The purpose is suppose to help others get information about what is going on, to allow teachers and students to get work and to check grades and allow parents to check for events.
        <br>
        <br>

        <li>Referring to the section in the handout titled Guidelines for effective use of web graphics, how well does the page you selected meet these guidelines? Which guidelines does it do especially well on, if any? Which guidelines does it fail to meet?</li>
        <br>
        The web graphics on the page are well done and do not get int the way, these graphics do meet the guidelines for the handout. The guide lines it does especially well is that it allows the viewer to focus on what is important on the page, the graphics fit on the page with a purpose and is orabized, and the page avoids using graphics that would be obnoxious or brightly colored.
        <br>
        The website I chose did not fail any of the guidelines for web graphics.
        <br>
        <h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
        <li>Pixels:They are tiny dots of color known as pixels and each digital image is comprised of thousands to millions of individual pixels.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Resolution: It is the number of pixels that are displayed per inch of an image and most computer monitors sisplay at the resolutions of 72 pixels per inch.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lossy Compression: It is the result of lost data and quality from the original version and it is associated with files like jpeg and Gif, It does however take up less space on the disk file by lossing some of the data for the image.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Lossless Compression: It reduces the file size with no loss of quality and pixels, it can be used for audio files and image files and it rewrites the data of the original file in a more effective way but the file takes uop more space on the disk file then the lossy compression.</li>
        <br>
        <li>JPEG: It stands for Joint Photographic Expert Groups, it is a lossy format that uses a 24-bit mage format and uses 16.8 million colors. It is not idea; for images with lots of lines and text due to them lossing data after compression.</li>
        <br>
        <li>PNG: Portable Network Graphics, this is a image format that is designed for the web. It takes the best parts of JPEG and GIF and it comes in the two formats of PNG-24 and PNG-8. PNG-8 can display a maximum of 256 colors while PNG-24 format can display millions of colors and is good for photographs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>SVG:Scalable Vector Graphics, it is a vector format that is widely popular because of the diffent uses that can come from it. SVG can be modified using CSS and Java Scripts and are very scalable. They are great for reponsive design and is best suited for logos, icons, maps, flags, charts, and other graphics.</li>
        <br>
        <li>GIF: Graphics Interchange Format, it can only support 256 colors but it can be used for graphics with a low pixel to pixel variation such as logos and icons.</li>
